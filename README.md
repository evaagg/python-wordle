Writing wordle in python

I am attempting to recreate the popular New York Times game, Wordle, using Python. The structure of my code is as follows:

1. Coloring letters based on guess (green, grey, red)
2. Creating guess keyboard
3. Initializing the Game Board (reseting it everytime)
4. Updating Game Board
5. User input
6. Integrating all the couterparts
